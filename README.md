# Services App with Backend

The application is made as part of an assignment for the course Web and Mobile Development at Habib University. 

## How to start the application (with backend)

### Initial node_modules installation

Before proceeding, run `npm install` in both the folders `services-start` and `services-backend`. Then proceed ahead.

### Frontend

`cd` into the `services-start` directory and run `ng-serve`. This would run the frontend on `http://localhost:4200/`. Automatic reload would be enabled. Frontend is made using Angular.

### Backend

`cd` into the `services-backend` directory and run `npm run dev`. This would start the backend server on `http://localhost:3080/`. The backend is built on NodeJS and Express and uses nodemon for automatic reload.

### Interaction

The frontend can be used to make http requests to the backend with the use of proxying to the relevant port. While the backend sends responses and relevant data according to the requests to the frontend.
